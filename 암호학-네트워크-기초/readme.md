# Learning Cryptography and Network Security essentials
Internet is a public network where everyone can participate in, meaning there might be some of the hackers and attackers in the network. This is where the importance of security comes into play

## CIA triad
> The CIA triad is a widely used information security model that can guide an organization's efforts and policies aimed at keeping its data secure. 

>  the initials stand for the three principles on which infosec rests:

1. Confidentiality: Only authorized users and processes should be able to access or modify data
1. Integrity: Data should be maintained in a correct state and nobody should be able to improperly modify it, either accidentally or maliciously
1. Availability: Authorized users should be able to access data whenever they need to do so

## OSI security architecture
OSI security architecture consists of following elements. 

1. security attack : action that compromises the security of an individual or an organization. 
1. security mechanism
1. security service

### Security attack
Types of security attacks are as follows. 

1. Passive attack : attemps to steal and read information from the system. it does not affect system resources since its purpose is to secretly monitor the system.

1. Active attack : involves the data modification. unlike passive attack, this type of attack tries to manipulate the data stream between sender and receiver.
