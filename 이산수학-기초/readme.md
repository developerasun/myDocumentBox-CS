# Learning Discrete Mathematics Essentials 
> What is discrete math, and how does it apply to programming? Math is an important part of all programming. Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are unique (aka discrete). Think integers, graphs, and logical statementsâ€”things we use a lot in programming. Discrete math can be used for software design specifications, analysis of algorithms, and other practical applications, but it's really a great tool to develop as a programmer. Put simply, it's a building block for logical thinking.

> Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are countable or are discrete in nature. In this course, we will deal with various types of discrete structures like graphs, groups, sets, relations, functions, etc
